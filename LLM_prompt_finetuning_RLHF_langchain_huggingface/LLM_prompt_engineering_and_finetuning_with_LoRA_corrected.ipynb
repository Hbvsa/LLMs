        "PEFT is a generic term that includes **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and prompt tuning (which is NOT THE SAME as prompt engineering!). In most cases, when someone says PEFT, they typically mean LoRA. LoRA, at a very high level, allows the user to fine-tune their model using fewer compute resources (in some cases, a single GPU). After fine-tuning for a specific task, use case, or tenant with LoRA, the result is that the original LLM remains unchanged and a newly-trained “LoRA adapter” emerges. This LoRA adapter is much, much smaller than the original LLM - on the order of a single-digit % of the original LLM size (MBs vs GBs).  \n",
        "\n",
        "That said, at inference time, the LoRA adapter needs to be reunited and combined with its original LLM to serve the inference request.  The benefit, however, is that many LoRA adapters can re-use the original LLM which reduces overall memory requirements when serving multiple tasks and use cases.\n",
