# LLMs

This repo has examples of:
- Prompting techinques
- Rag
- LangChain
- PAL
- Multimodality
- ChatBot
- HuggingFaceHub
- OpenAI api
- Gemini api

I will now quickly describe the purpose of each folder/file.

# The folder Prompting_examples_and_simple_chat_bot contains two notebooks:
- Chat_bot - Simple GUI with gpt 3.5 turbo with OpenAI api to build a user<->model chat to process pizza orders.
- prompt_tactics_examples - Illustrates several LLM prompt tactics to enhance the responses generated by the models

# The file Langchain_RAG_intro_OpenAI:
- How to use LangChain combined with OpenAI models through their api to create a RAG system 

# The folder LLM_prompt_finetuning_RLHF_langchain_huggingface:
- The prompt engineering file showcases how to use huggingface models with prompt engineering and how to finetune them using LoRA
- Reinforcement Learning file showcases how to use RLHF with a PPO algorithm to align the responses of an LLM to be less toxic
- Running models with LangChain with the HuggingFace api or loading them from HuggingFace to run locally 
# Gemini_multi_tools
- LangChain with Google's Gemini Model using their API.
- Rag
- PAL
- Multimodal usecase
